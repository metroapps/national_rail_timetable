        <h1>How to use this website</h1>
        <h2>Basic usage</h2>
        <p>
            The home page shows the form below: <br/>
            <img src="/images/help/form.png" alt="Entry form"/><br/>
            Enter either the full name or the 3-letter CRS code of the station,
            choose either departures or arrivals,
            and tap either "Show timetable" or "Show board" button.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the browser supports the use of <code>datalist</code> HTML tag,
            it will suggest the stations while typing into the field.
        </p>
        <h3>Timetable view</h3>
        <p>
            The departures / arrivals of a station are grouped into timetables
            not sharing any common calls apart from the specified station. For
            example, generating a timetable from
            <a href="/timetable.php?station=BSK">Basingstoke</a>
            will normally results in 4 timetables, for trains to London
            Waterloo, Manchester Piccadilly, Weymouth / Portsmouth and Exeter
            St Davids respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each timetable is presented in a table which fits in the viewport,
            as shown below:
            <br/>
            <img src="/images/help/timetable.png" alt="timetable" />
        </p>
        <p>
            The heading shows the furthest place the trains go. If there is a
            station where all trains in the timetable will call, the heading
            also shows that as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The table heading shows, for each train, the 2-letter code of the
            Train Operating Company operating the train, the headcode (normally
            either the train number for a reservable service, or the route code
            otherwise), the 3-letter code of the origin and destination, the
            icons of the facilities available, and the platform where the train
            calls at if known.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a departure timetable, the departure times of the station
            specified are shown, followed by the arrival times of each
            subsequent call. For an arrival timetable, the departure times of
            each preceding call are shown, following by the arrival times of the
            station specified.
        </p>
        <p>
            If Javascript is enabled, the table is automatically scrolled to the
            relevant time, which is the connection time is given, or the time
            now if not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The letter u, s or x next to a time indicates that the station call
            is pick-up only, set-down only, or a request stop.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a time spans across multiple columns, it indicates that the train
            will divide to (in a departure timetable) or has joined from (in an
            arrival timetable) multiple portions.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a connection time is given, each column is colour-coded in
            <span class="valid_connection">green</span> if the train is a
            valid connection, or <span class="invalid_connection">red</span>
            otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a time is <span class="overtaken">greyed out</span>, it means
            that the train is overtaken by a faster train between the station
            specified and the station of that row.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tapping a station in the timetable, except for the station
            specified, links to the timetable for the station tapped. Tapping
            a calling time in the timetable links to the timetable for that
            station as well, with the time given as the connection such that
            the trains are labelled as valid connection or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tapping the departure / arrival time at the station specified links
            to the details of the train.
        </p>
        <h3>Board view</h3>
        <p>
            Using the "show board" button instead of "show timetable" brings the
            board view instead:<br/>
            <img src="/images/help/board.png" alt="Board" />
        </p>
        <p>
            It shows the departure or arrival board of the station specified.
            If Javascript is enabled, the page is automatically scrolled to the
            relevant time as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The departure board shows each train in a row, including its
            departure / arrival time at the station specified, the facilities
            available, the platform, the Train Operating Company, the
            destination / origin of the train, and the subsequent / preceding
            calls. The connections are also colour-coded as described above
            as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Different to the timetable, due to the lack of space, the departure
            board doesn't show the headcode, which can still be seen in the
            service detail page. In addition, the greying out of overtaken
            trains only works if there is exactly one filter station specified,
            where overtaken trains between the station specified and the filter
            station are greyed out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tapping a calling station also links to the board of that station
            as well with the connection time given, same as in the timetable.
        </p>
        <h3>Service detail</h3>
        <p>
            Tapping the departure / arrival time of the timetable of the board
            brings up the service detail page:<br/>
            <img src="/images/help/service_details.png" alt="Service details" />
        </p>
        <p>
            The page shows the service information, including the train number,
            train category, signalling identity, headcode, traction,
            maximum speed, the days when the train run, and the facilities
            available.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also shows the scheduled passenger calls of the train as well,
            including if it is pick-up only, set-down only, a request stop, or
            if a reversal is made at the station.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tapping a time links to the departure board (for an arrival time) or
            the arrival board (for a departure time) for the station, with the
            time given as the connection time.
        </p>
        <h2>Advanced usage</h2>
        <h3>Bookmarking a timetable</h3>
        <p>
            All timetable, board and service details pages are bookmarkable. If
            the date is not specified in the form, the URL generated is always
            for today's timetable or board. Combined with the auto-scrolling,
            the scheduled train times for your favourite station now
            can be easily accessed by just opening a bookmark.
        </p>
        <h3>Filtering trains</h3>
        <p>
            The timetable / board can be filtered such that only trains which
            call at specified stations, or which don't call at specified
            stations are shown.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you want to generate a timetable
            <a href="/timetable.php?station=WAT&amp;filter[]=BSK&amp;inverse_filter[]=HOK">
                from London Waterloo to Basingstoke with fast trains only</a>,
            you can enter London Waterloo as the departure station, enter
            Basingstoke into one of the "only trains calling at" boxes such that
            only trains to Basingstoke are shown, and enter Hook into one of the
            "but not at" boxes such that the slow trains, which call at Hook,
            are not shown.
